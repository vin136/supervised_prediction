        """Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is a versatile indicator that can be used to identify a new trend or warn of extreme conditions.
        CCI measures the current price level relative to an average price level over a given period of time.
        The CCI typically oscillates above and below a zero line. Normal oscillations will occur within the range of +100 and −100.
        Readings above +100 imply an overbought condition, while readings below −100 imply an oversold condition.
        As with other overbought/oversold indicators, this means that there is a large probability that the price will correct to more representative levels.
